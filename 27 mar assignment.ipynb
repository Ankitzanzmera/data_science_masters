This can lead to overfitting the model to the training data and poor performance on new, unseen data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpretability: The addition of a penalty term to the cost function of regularized linear models can make the resulting models more complex and difficult to interpret. This can make it harder to understand the relationship between the input features and the target variable.\n",

    "Handling nonlinear relationships: Regularized linear models can only model linear relationships between the input features and the target variable. If there are nonlinear relationships between these variables, such as interactions between features or nonlinear transformations of the input features, then regularized linear models may not be able to capture them effectively.\n",
