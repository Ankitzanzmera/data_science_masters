    "In a stationary time series, the mean, variance, and covariance are constant over time. This means that the distribution of the data does not change with time, and the relationships between the variables in the series are stable. In contrast, a non-stationary time series may exhibit trends, seasonal patterns, or other changes over time that make it difficult to model or forecast accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stationarity of a time series affects the choice of forecasting model because most forecasting models assume that the time series is stationary. If the time series is non-stationary, then the model may produce inaccurate forecasts because it is not accounting for the changing statistical properties of the data.\n",

    "To address this issue, techniques such as differencing can be used to transform a non-stationary time series into a stationary one. Differencing involves subtracting each observation from the previous observation to remove trends or other patterns that may be present in the data. Once a stationary time series has been obtained, a variety of forecasting models can be applied, including ARIMA, SARIMA, and exponential smoothing models.\n",
