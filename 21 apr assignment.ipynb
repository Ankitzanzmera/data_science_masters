Euclidean distance is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the coordinates of two points, while Manhattan distance is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the coordinates of two points.\n",

Euclidean distance is more sensitive to the influence of outliers or extreme values, since the squared differences can become very large. Manhattan distance, on the other hand, is more robust to outliers, since the absolute differences do not become as large as the squared differences in Euclidean distance."

    "Euclidean distance works well when the data is continuous and features are normalized. In contrast, Manhattan distance is more appropriate when the data is not normalized or contains outliers, as it is more robust to outliers.\n",

    "In situations where the data has different scales, it is often recommended to use normalization or standardization to ensure that all features have similar scales. This is because features with larger scales will have a larger impact on the distance metric, and may lead to bias in the KNN algorithm.\n",
