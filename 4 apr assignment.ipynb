    "The geometric intuition behind decision tree classification is based on the idea of partitioning the feature space into smaller regions that correspond to different decision boundaries, where each boundary separates the data points of different classes. A decision tree is constructed by recursively splitting the feature space into smaller regions using a series of if-else conditions on the feature values, until the regions become pure, i.e., they contain data points of only one class.\n",

    "For example, consider a binary classification problem where we have two classes of data points in a two-dimensional feature space. A decision tree can be constructed by making splits along the x-axis and y-axis, which would create rectangular regions in the feature space that correspond to different classes. The decision tree can then be used to make predictions for new data points by checking which region they belong to based on their feature values, and assigning them the class label associated with that region.\n",

    "In higher-dimensional feature spaces, the decision boundaries created by the splits can be visualized as hyperplanes that separate the feature space into different regions. The decision tree can then be used to make predictions for new data points by checking which region they belong to based on their feature values, and assigning them the class label associated with that region.\n",

    "The advantage of using a decision tree classifier is that it creates a set of simple decision rules that can be easily interpreted and understood, and can capture complex decision boundaries in the feature space.
