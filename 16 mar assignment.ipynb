    "    With the increase in the training data, the crucial features to be extracted become prominent. The model can recognize the relationship between the input attributes and the output variable. The only assumption in this method is that the data to be fed into the model should be clean; otherwise, it would worsen the problem of overfitting.\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "3. Addition of noise to the input data : Another similar option as data augmentation is adding noise to the input and output data. Adding noise to the input makes the model stable without affecting data quality and privacy while adding noise to the output makes the data more diverse. Noise addition should be done in limit so that it does not make the data incorrect or too different.\n",

Feature selection : Every model has several parameters or features depending upon the number of layers, number of neurons, etc.  The model can detect many redundant features or features determinable from other features leading to unnecessary complexity.

    "5. Regularization : If overfitting occurs when a model is too complex, reducing the number of features makes sense. Regularization methods like Lasso, L1 can be beneficial if we do not know which features to remove from our model. Regularization applies a \"penalty\" to the input parameters with the larger coefficients, which subsequently limits the model's variance. \n",

    "Underfitting : A statistical model or a machine learning algorithm is said to have underfitting when it cannot capture the underlying trend of the data, i.e., it only performs well on training data but performs poorly on testing data. (Itâ€™s just like trying to fit undersized pants!) Underfitting destroys the accuracy of our machine learning model. Its occurrence simply means that our model or the algorithm does not fit the data well enough. It usually happens when we have fewer data to build an accurate model and also when we try to build a linear model with fewer non-linear data. In such cases, the rules of the machine learning model are too easy and flexible to be applied to such minimal data and therefore the model will probably make a lot of wrong predictions. Underfitting can be avoided by using more data and also reducing the features by feature selection. "
