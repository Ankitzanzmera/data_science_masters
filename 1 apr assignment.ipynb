    "Linear regression and logistic regression are both types of statistical models used for analyzing relationships between variables. However, they differ in terms of their dependent variables, output, and application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is used to predict a continuous numerical outcome based on one or more independent variables. The output of a linear regression model is a continuous value, which represents the predicted value of the dependent variable. For example, a linear regression model could be used to predict the price of a house based on its size, number of bedrooms, location, and other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression, on the other hand, is used to predict the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more independent variables. The output of a logistic regression model is a probability value between 0 and 1, which represents the likelihood of the dependent variable being in one of two categories (e.g., \"yes\" or \"no\"). For example, logistic regression could be used to predict the likelihood of a patient having a particular disease based on their age, gender, and other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scenarios where the outcome variable is categorical or binary, logistic regression is more appropriate than linear regression. For example, if you are trying to predict whether a customer will buy a product or not based on their demographic and purchase history, logistic regression would be more appropriate. Another example would be to predict the probability of a customer churning (i.e. canceling a subscription) based on their usage patterns and other relevant factors."
