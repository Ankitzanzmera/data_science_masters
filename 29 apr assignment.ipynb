    "Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning technique that involves grouping similar data points together based on their intrinsic characteristics or patterns. The goal is to identify meaningful clusters in the data, where data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.\n",

    "The basic concept of clustering involves finding patterns, structures, or relationships in data without any prior knowledge or labels. It helps to discover hidden patterns, identify natural groupings, and gain insights into the underlying structure of the data.\n",

    "Here are a few examples of applications where clustering is useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer Segmentation: Clustering can be used to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors, demographics, or preferences. This information can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies, personalize customer experiences, and optimize product offerings.\n",

    "- Image Segmentation: Clustering can be applied to segment images into meaningful regions or objects based on their visual similarities. It finds applications in various fields such as computer vision, medical imaging, and autonomous driving.\n",

    "- Document Clustering: Clustering can be used to group similar documents together based on their content, topics, or language. It enables tasks like document organization, information retrieval, and recommendation systems.\n",

    "- Anomaly Detection: Clustering can be used to identify unusual or anomalous patterns in data that do not conform to the expected behavior. It finds applications in fraud detection, network intrusion detection, and outlier detection.\n",
